# Visibility-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark 


This project encompasses a comprehensive data processing and analysis task utilizing various Big Data technologies, including Hadoop, PySpark, Pig, and Hive. It is structured into four parts:

## Part 1: 
Development of Mapper and Reducer applications to calculate the range of sky ceiling height for each observation month.

## Part 2: 
Implementation of a PySpark application to compute the average visibility distance for each USAF weather station ID.
## Part 3: 
Loading a text file into Pig and extracting the range of sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID.
## Part 4: 

Loading a text file into Hive and obtaining the average sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID.

## Usage Instructions
## PySpark Configuration: 
Ensure correct installation and configuration of PySpark.
## Data Preparation: 
Preprocess NCDC records and place them in the specified input directories.
## Execution: 
Execute the appropriate scripts for each project part and handle output accordingly.
## Technical Considerations: 

Pay attention to SparkContext configuration and file path settings for seamless execution.
